# huffman-coding
An implementation of Huffman's coding algorithm. The project was not intended for practical use and was created solely for educational purposes.

**NOTE:** I have later implemented a better version as part of my [CS106B assignment 6](https://github.com/Lrapava/CS106B-Homework/tree/master/assignment-6)
